# Morimiya Middle School Shooting

It is what it is.

This game's pile of negative reviews are entertainingly simple. What did you people expect?

It's an RPGmaker game revolving around a few key images and a premise. Those images are of a haunted, schizotypal girl in a striking anime Japanese school girl uniform carrying a 22 rifle and wearing a chest rig full of ammunition, surrounded by bodies. She is a beautiful anime girl school shooter.

These images don't really form a literary narrative, there's a mood and an idea here. That's the whole game. If you look into the game thinking you'll anything different to or deeper than than the first image you saw you won't find it. Only iteration, through itself is like a drawing. Specifically it's like the (very striking) drawings which are the game's key-art pieces as viewed outside of the game (like the poster style crop used on this game's page). The game's scenario, or brief series of scenarios, are detail rich pieces of artifice which are on one level alternate attempts to convey the same thingsthe images. Detachment. Pop-realist detail. Brutality. Rage and tragedy The "game" section of this "game" can be played as such. It keeps score, rather morbidly. But it can also be simply scrutinised and taken in, like looking at an image. Admire its relatively grounded and complete depiction of a complete Japanese Middle school in the RPGmaker engine. Note that students outside are in sports uniforms, there are multiple buildings to enter, events implied to be in progress right before you arrive. The game's world tells a story, and that story is completely mundane. There is no evidence of some conspiracy to torture (and so justify) the protagonist, no greater background details beyond what we know before we begin. This is a completely ordinary depiction of an ordinary school. You are the extraordinary element. And your only potential interactions with this school are very extreme, but in their own way also extremely mundane.

You are playing as a teenage girl with guns. In typical Japanese fashion, your control scheme brings to mind a person manipulating an object, with multiple inputs required to do anything effectively. This creates a strange sense of distance between you and doing damage to people. There is no seamless feedback you are the weapon fluidity here. A gun is a hard metal object which has to be correctly manipulated to send more hard metal flying. And the protagonist herself, hunting humans is a difficult, demanding task. She (you) has to consider her movements carefully. Moving quickly is tiring and destabilising. Aiming precisely is slow and locks you down. This fiddly and never quite comfortable approach to representing a person handling a gun opens you up to jarringly plausible possible experiences. Sprinting desperately to keep up with someone can leave you open to being knocked sprawling by an adult stepping around a corner, ending the rampage on the spot.

You can violently explore the school for five minutes before the police arrive and force an ending upon you. No matter what you do your experience will be short and bad for all involved. And then the game returns you to the protagonist's demented home to start again. Different weapons can be collected and used, each feels remarkably different in its implementation and handling. And perks can be paid for which will empower you on future rampages, allowing you to attempt to kill more people. It's all ultimately the sameexperience. Which you can poke, mess around in, and explore the limits of to your own personal satisfaction.

I see no reason to be upset with this game. It is a depiction and exploration of a taboo subject, and an invitation to explore for yourself. I personally find the "key-art" beautiful,and am fascinated with the "game" as an attempt at evoking through novel virtual interactive scenario construction what this artist could already do brilliantly through static visual art.

If this game were made by a white person and he called it a virtual multimedia installation he would be hailed as a challenging genius. And that is an accurate description of what has happened here. This particular artist just lacks a prestigious body willing to support him. But for whatever it's worth, he has me.

Morimiya Middle School Shooting is a striking person of art and I sincerely recommend you look at it if you believe video games can be a tool for artists rather than merely "games" on a screen.
