# Katana Zero

3 stars of shame.

This game invites lots of comparisons. That doesn't have to be a bad thing. It invites comparisons because it is a mechanical riff on things which already exist, and its style and content are pure pastiche. Not axiomatically bad. But I found it very uninteresting and unimpressive.

Samurai Gunn is the professed influence I can find on wikipedia. And Justin Stander is clearly not lying. Hotline Miami is the other clear influence he doesn't want us talking about, but is obviously there. Another nobody even talks about is Mark of the Ninja. Between the three you pretty much have the bones of this game. The rest is a checklist TIGsource memes.

And then the game's tone, style, and content, these can all be traced to particular things. Hotline Miami, Punch Club, Akira, John Wick, these are the things he takes directly from. Beyond that things get anxious and strange. The game has the "indie" style and brandings, and more particularly, the "80s indie" style. This is a style for people who love "Indie" things marketing themselves as "throwbacks". Not the 80s. Even the original creators of these things didn't actually like the 80s. They like a strange fantasy of the 80s where there was lots of kitsch garbage and purple and everything was very friendly and harmless and open but EXTREME in a non-threatening way. Action movie kitsch made queer.

Where I'm going with this is that I don't get the impression that any of this means anything to Justin Stander. "His" work is entirely a product of surrounding cultural fashions and trends. The game doesn't look or sound like any particular thing, reflect the will or taste or style of any particular person, this game is distilled TIGsource nerdcore twee aspirational junk culture.

Jonatan Soderstrom and Denis Wedin clearly have a more particular interest in the historic American 80s (Manny Pardo was a real person, the Miami of the game's setting is a distortion of a real counterpart), and a stronger aesthetic vision drawing upon and using the idea. The American 80s of colour, light, and excess is a fantasy of apocalyptic maximalism. The whole world doing drugs and stimulating itself into a violent frenzy which is going to consume everything and everyone. This is striking and compelling and I feel that it authentically reflects a real human perspective.

Hotline Miami 2 and Katana Zero both feature a fictional Vietnam War analog as a key backstory element. What this war means to the creators of HM2 is clear. It's a connection to Apocalypse Now. Which is a connection to a continuity of fever-dream visions of apocalyptic violence. They are taking their artistic inspirations into their own world and making it theirs. But why did Justin Stander put Vietnam in Katana Zero? As far as I can tell, because the TIGsource checklist says you do THEMES and some party-approved themes are 'TRAUMA' and 'WAR BAD'. So katana zero guy is apparently a disturbed war veteran when we're not making jokes about lame anime culture or indulging in pointless john wick violence.

Hotline Miami feels like a work which grew organically out of a vision. Katana Zero feels like an attempt at synthesising the appeal of a work like Hotline Miami. The base of Katana Zero is a simple game-jam concept, and then we get this greater work of dialogue driven cutscenes built up to frame it, but what's it ultimately for? Where is it going? I'm not saying a 2019 indie game has to solve all of my existential concerns to be justified, but it feels like a game which exists because someone wanted to be "a guy who made a game". And he did it. Here it is. Authentic Indie Video Game Product by Justin Stander.

I think it's a great shame when an ostensibly independent and personal work leaves me with as great a sense of "what the hell was the point of that?" as something out of the corporate pipeline worked on by 700 people. Has Justin Stander done something really unique and brilliant? Or is this work a product of a smaller pipeline that insists it's not a pipeline?

There is fun to be had here I suppose, but I also feel like I could have a kind of fun if I were to play the latest Watch Dogs game for 3 hours.

Also I didn't recall a single piece of music from this game after playing it and have no desire to look for any.
