# Shellshock 2: Blood trails

Iâ€™m very fond of this one.

I personally miss when games had a start, middle, and end. Exciting production values. A few key ideas they really wanted to show me and no room for much else. This game is very short, but it's a lot of things.

First of all, it's BRITISH. And NOT MADE BY THE SHELLSHOCK: NAM 67' devs. Many of the reviews are confused on that point. This game came from nowhere despite having a "2" and a subtitle. Those are just tools to psychologically stun gamers into a purchase-trance.

Someone at Rebellion Derby loves shoving zombies into any premise they currently have. They put zombies into Judge Dredd. They put zombies into WW2 sniping. And they put zombies into Viet-Fuckin'-Nam!

Specifically, the zombies from 28 Days and Weeks Later. This game is obviously and  undeniably a result of key figures at Rebellion: Derby seeing those movies and thinking "we got this vietnam project, put em' in Vietnam, flippin' mental yeah?". And yes, it's fucking awesome.

This game sells on a very simple premise. Zombies attacking American GIs in Vietnam. You're either sold or you're not. And if that premise sells to you, you shouldn't be disappointed.

The game is criticised by others here as an "FPS". But that's myopic and silly. It's 2024. If you want a refined "fps" experience divorced from context, you have them. Plenty compete for your attention. Searching through linear narrative/premise games from 2009 for pure "FPS" is deranged. You go for linear narrative/premise games because the premise grabs you, and you hope the game front delivers on or facilitates that premise in an entertaining fashion.

And this game does. It is not an innovative or bleeding edge example of "FPS" form. But it is perfectly good enough to convey an experience of 28 Days Later zombies breaking out in Vietnam. Your movement is a bit stiff and simple, perhaps just enough to facilitate slight claustrophobia and not let you get too comfortable in moving around. Gun handling is very simple, and the guns are cool and well rendered. I'm playing a Vietnam game to see a few specific ones, and I see them and I like them. Not quite Rising Storm 2, but I'm happy.

The scenarios you play through, these are the substance of the game. This game is fast. There's always stuff happening. Characters running around and stuff exploding, or you're thrown into a spooky place and need to power through, you should never be bored by this game. Things move fast and they only have so much to show you. They probably didn't have the time or money to render anything superfluous to the core vision. Which in retrospect is great. This game is abandonware, it only costs time, and that time is dense with detail the creators obviously thought was their good stuff.

Not much to say. It's a console-ready shooter from 2009 that rides or dies on its premise. And that premise might last you 2.5 or 3 hours for one go. Personally I like shooting guns in video games, but really like when that can be integrated into something that's of interest to me, or at least novel. And really think, the "better" games from this era, are you going back to play them? Was Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare really doing anything that interesting, or was it just the sleekest at the time bleeding edge implementation of fast paced "FPS" action intended to be appreciated more in a vacuum of multiplayer than integrated into a complete experience?

For what it's worth, I somewhat regularly go back to Shellshock 2. I don't go back to any other "FPS" of its era. Perhaps that says something about where the real value in such "FPS" games might actually lie.
