# Using Sidenotes

This is an example page demonstrating the implementation of sidenotes.js. Sidenotes are a way to display footnotes in the margin of a page, making them more accessible and easier to read.

## Basic Footnotes

Here's a paragraph with a basic footnote[^1]. You can see how the footnote appears in the margin when the viewport is wide enough.

[^1]: This is a basic footnote that will be displayed as a sidenote in wide viewports.

## Multiple Footnotes

You can have multiple footnotes in a single paragraph[^2], and they will all be displayed as sidenotes when the viewport is wide enough[^3].

[^2]: This is the second footnote.
[^3]: This is the third footnote.

## Long Footnotes

You can also have longer footnotes with multiple paragraphs[^4].

[^4]: This is a longer footnote with multiple paragraphs.

It contains more information that would be useful to the reader without interrupting the flow of the main text.

## Margin Notes

You can also use margin notes to add additional information to your text. For example, this paragraph has a margin note that provides a summary or additional context.

<span class="marginnote">This is a margin note that provides additional context for the paragraph.</span>

## Code Blocks in Footnotes

You can even include code blocks in your footnotes[^5].

[^5]: ```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
```

## Tables in Footnotes

You can also include tables in your footnotes[^6].

[^6]: | Header 1 | Header 2 |
    |----------|----------|
    | Cell 1   | Cell 2   |
    | Cell 3   | Cell 4   |

## Images in Footnotes

You can even include images in your footnotes[^7].
